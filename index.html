<p class="center" style="text-align:justify;font-size:20px;color:#ffffff;">Once in a time where fancy lay and little girls wore ruffles and lace, there was a mum with four daughters so fair the eye would take notice to such beauty none other could compare. It was in the year, circa 1902 - a time of transition from old to new. And I was there amongst the family to bear witness to the joy that lingered in four young faces and a mum so rare. It was the time of Edwardian splendor when girls danced at cotillions when they were the age for such grandure. It was a time when mums bought sweets for their sweeties and presented their daughters as pure little princesses whether rich or pauper, all girls were and mums all the while reminded them of the royalness thereof. &nbsp;&nbsp;<i style="text-align:right;">~REICH~</i></p>
